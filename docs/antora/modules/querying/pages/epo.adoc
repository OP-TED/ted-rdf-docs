= The eProcurement Ontology

The eProcurement Ontology (ePO) is the controlled vocabulary which formally describes the classes (concepts), attributes, relationships, and cardinalities of the language used in EU public procurement. The ontology is essential so that all contributing parties and reusers of the data can be certain that the concepts and definitions they use are the same.

The ePO provides essential resources and artifacts to help those wishing to query the data:

* Glossaries - searchable lists of classes and their definitions
* Conceptual Models - visual representations of the classes and their relationships to each other, hierarchies, and cardinalities
* Guides to using the eProcurement Ontology in constructing queries
* Info sessions on some of the basic concepts
