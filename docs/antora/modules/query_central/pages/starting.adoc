== Topics:

=== An overview of Proc data, 
=== notice to rdf format process
=== how rdf data is queried

=== Links to good training resources for learning sparql:

 * (rdf & sparql/ ePO lesson/ etc n)
 * videos
 * w3c
 * YouTube lectures
 * other web training courses

=== Links to Achilles's guides

=== Flow diagramme of frequently used classes: buyer, seller, value, date, country, business size, cpv codes, lots

=== Short explanations of confusing things:

* duplicate data
* understanding lots
* what data is available (from which notices and over what time period)?
* how the evolution of ePO affects classes and data availability (history & evolution)
* in WHERE statements: declaring a variable as an epo class
