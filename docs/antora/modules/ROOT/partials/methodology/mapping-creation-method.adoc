== Mapping development methodology

This section gives a high-level overview of the process for creating the mapping rules for transforming XML TED notices into RDF triples that use ePO terms (classes).

The methodology described focuses on the steps and artefacts at the core of  <<mapping-creation>>. This diagram shows a subsection of the mapping lifecycle.

Following the theoretical framework, and learning from the manual creation of mappings, the mapping creation process has been enhanced and refined.

The focus here is on describing the steps by which the *conceptual mapping* and the *technical mapping* are created.

== Summary of the Steps and sub-steps

=== Creation of conceptual mappings:

. The identification of the form elements (and the corresponding XML elements and XPaths) to be mapped
. The identification of the eForm Business Terms (BT) corresponding to the XML elements (optional)
. The identification of the ePO terms (classes and relations) that correspond to XML elements and their relationships
. The identification of the value sets in XML
. The identification of the value sets in ePO, and in other vocabularies corresponding to XML controlled values used in the XML files
. Writing Turtle fragments that provide a template for the triples that should be generated, and which can be used in the RML mapping rules
* The identification and documentation of problems/issue/questions that are to be clarified with external experts

=== Creation of technical mappings:

. The identification of the sources that are necessary to execute a mapping
. The preparation of vocabulary files, and other “dictionaries” that are to be used as resources for the mapping
. The preparation of test data
. Writing YARRRML rules (optional)
. Writing RML rules (or convert YARRRML rules to RML) and test them
. Documenting problems and creating (Helpdesk)tasks to find solutions for them

=== Testing the mapping to identify potential problems and improvments:

. Running the mapping on all test notices files and analysing the output
. Generating the various validation outputs (SHACL shapes, SPARQL queries etc.), for all test data and analyse it
. Executing any other steps in the mapping development lifecycle to find potential issues and refine the mapping

== A detailed description of the steps

=== Steps involved in the conceptual mapping process

The conceptual mapping is the first artefact that must be created. It requires a thorough understanding of the content of a form (standard or eForm), and all the related concepts in the ePO ontology. It will most likely involve rounds of discussions with subject experts. Below, some of the sub-steps involved in developing the conceptual mapping are described.

==== Identification of the Form Elements (and the Corresponding XML Elements and XPaths) that are to be mapped

The identification of the the XML elements that contain information to be mapped to RDF requires that the following are examined:

* The “Standard Forms to eForms” mapping table that corresponds to the form that is to be mapped is used. This provides both the list of the form elements, and XPath expressions that can be used to retrieve the desired information:  XML elements, attributes, etc, from the XML data.

NOTE: XPaths can be straight forward or complex. Multiple XPaths are used to retrieve alternative values. These XPaths need to be tested to establish whether simpler, better and/or more appropriate ones can be written.

* The *TED_EXPORT.xsd* schema file, corresponding to the XML version to be mapped.

NOTE:  Special attention should be paid to the structure of the XML document (especially when we have repeating elements, or multiple levels of nesting, sometimes involving elements with very similar names)

* The *PDF form* being mapped, to make sure that all elements are considered vered and the correct semantic of the fields has been identified.

* Individual XML notices available in the test data set, as well as data extracted from these and compiled in tables to provide an overview of the different values  contained in test data  fields.

==== The Identification of eForm Business Terms (BT) corresponding to the XML elements (optional)
Although this is not necessary for the conversion of the Standard Form XML to RDF data, it is still useful, from a future-oriented perspective,  to identify the eForm Business Terms corresponding to each Standard Form element. This is relatively straight forward using the “Standard Forms to eForms” mapping table.

==== The Identification of ePO terms (classes and relations) that correspond to XML elements and their relationships
In this step, the relevant classes, class attributes, and relationships between the ePO classes used to represent the information contained in the XML elements is identified. This requires a deep understanding of the ePO model.

Identifying the relevant ePO terms may be complex, as there is a significant difference between the conceptualisations and abstractions made in the two models, and also in the names used for the same concept between models. Consultion with subject matter experts regarding the structure and content of the ePO model, is highly recommended.

Any problems or discrepancies discovered, that prevent the creation of a perfect (one-to-one) mapping, should be documented. This should be recorded both on the spreadsheet (e.g. by highlighting problematic cells in certain colours and/or adding comments to them), and by describing issues in a separate document that is reviewed and addressed by ePO experts.

==== The Identification of value sets in XML

To identify the value sets (i.e. the possible different values) that are used in the XML data, either as certain element names, or attribute values), the following are examined:

* The *TED_EXPORT.xsd* schema file, corresponding to the XML version being mapped,
* The values that appear in the sample XML notices.
* The *PDF form* that is being mapped, to establish whether the form specifies an obvious value set, e.g. by means of checkboxes or radio buttons.
* The authority tables used in the EPO available from the https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/authority-tables[EU Vocabularies]

==== The Identification of value sets in the ePO and other vocabularies corresponding to XML controlled values used in the XML files

In this step the identification of the different vocabularies referenced by ePO attributes and relationships involved in the mapping of a certain XML element is done. A familiarity with the vocabulary should be achieved. At a minimum, what namespace is used, what some of their values are, and how are they encoded should be understood (i.e. which properties they are using to encode labels, ids, etc).

==== Writing Turtle fragments that provide a template for the triples to be generated, that are used in the RML mapping rules

Below is an example of an input (XML notice's fragment), and it's transformation (RDF result) of an organisation definition.

===== XML fragment (source.xml)

----
<TED_EXPORT>
    <FORM_SECTION>
        <F03_2014 CATEGORY="ORIGINAL" FORM="F03" LG="PT">
            <CONTRACTING_BODY>
                <ADDRESS_CONTRACTING_BODY>
                    <OFFICIALNAME>Administração Regional de Saúde do Alentejo, I. P.</OFFICIALNAME>

            <CONTRACTING_BODY>

    a org:Organization;
    epo:hasName "Administração Regional de Saúde do Alentejo, I. P."@pt .

----
The corresponding RML rules to do such a transformation are in the section: <<_writing_rml_rules>>.

==== Identifying and documenting problems/issue/questions requiring consultation with external experts

The way RML rules are written (see <<_technical-mapping-modularisation-chapter,technical mapping chapter>>) is in a TripleMap.

Each one contains:

* "LogicalSource" that gives information about the *source* (XML file to transform)

* "referenceFormulation" which is the language used to parse the source.

An up to date version of RML Mapper that supports XPath 2.0/3.0 is used which supports the default namespaces.

=== The steps involved in the technical mapping process

This section describes what needs to be addressed in the technical mapping step of the mapping creation process.

==== The identification of the necessary sources for mapping execution

All necessary sources must be defined correctly in the YARRRML/RML files, and refer to files that already exist, or that will be available in the mapping package when running the mapping.

IMPORTANT: The path to the source files should be specified relative to the RML file(s) e.g., if the RML mapping files are in the transformation/mappings folder (as described above), then the sources they define should point to the `../../data/data.xml` file, respectively to the various `.json`, `.csv` and/or `.xml` files in the `./resources` folder

==== Preparation of vocabulary files, and other “dictionaries” used as resources for the mapping

====  Preparing test data

The xref:mapping:preparing-test-data.adoc[representative sample data selection chapter] should be referred to.

==== Writing YARRRML Rules (optional)

During the initial phase of the mapping creation process, the writing of the mapping rules in https://rml.io/yarrrml/spec/[YARRRML] (a human-readable text-based representation for declarative generation rules), instead of RML took place, because it seemed simpler, and the end result was more human friendly. However, as we gained more experience and confidence in how the mappings should be defined, we realised that writing RML rules directly could be even more powerful, and we started to rewrite all our YARRRML mapping rules into RML. If this transition proves to be successful, and writing RML rules directly will be more convenient, our process will not require writing YARRRML rules in the future. This is the reason for why this step is optional. It could be useful for small test cases, quick demos, or showcases, and in cases when some people are more familiar with YARRRML than RML. If people decide to write YARRRML rules, the next step will become unnecessary, as the RML rules will be automatically generated from the YARRRML rules, using xref:mapping:toolchain.adoc[dedicated tools] that were developed for this purpose.

Since this step is optional, the individual issues that need to be worked on will not be described in detail , but they are in principle the same as the ones described in the next section.

[#_writing_rml_rules]
==== Writing RML rules
In the previous step the mapping rules were defined in YARRRML. This step consists of the simple action of executing xref:mapping:toolchain.adoc[the tool that generates RML out of YARRRML].

Regardless of which file is chosen to be defined manually, YARRRML or RML, the goal of this step is to have an RML mapping file that should be able to convert an XML notice into a corresponding RDF graph.

*In the rest of this section the assumption is made that the RML rules are being written manually*, as this is the solution that offers the greatest potential benefit, and the approach that is likely to be pursued in the future.

The technical mappings are written in the https://rml.io/[RML mapping language]. The version of RML used is https://github.com/julianrojas87/rmlmapper-java[5.0.0-r362], which was recommended to us by Julian Rojas, its principal developer, in which  https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp[XPath] version https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/[3.1] is supported.

===== Prefix definition

To specify the technical mappings in RML, the definition of the prefixes that are used in the mapping file must be defined first. For example for the ePO ontology, the epo prefix name is defined as follows:

----
@prefix epo: <http://data.europa.eu/a4g/ontology#> .

----

The prefix names and their values, which are used in the RML file, should ALL be maintained in the https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-conversion-pipeline/blob/feature/TED-311/ted_sws/resources/prefixes/prefixes.json[`prefixes.json`] resource file. If the content of that file is maintained and kept up to date consistently, the entire prefix declaration section of the RML file could be automatically generated, and re-generated when necessary. (Note: Besides the individual prefixes, the array that is the assigned value to the `rml_rules` key should be viewed).

===== TriplesMap

After the definition of prefixes, the next step is to define the various TriplesMaps for the creation of class instances. For example, an organisation's technical mapping:

----
<#OrganisationMapping> a rr:TriplesMap ;
   rml:logicalSource
       [
           rml:source "source.xml" ;
           rml:referenceFormulation ql:XPath
           rml:iterator "/TED_EXPORT/FORM_SECTION/F03_2014/CONTRACTING_BODY/ADDRESS_CONTRACTING_BODY" ;

       ] ;
----

The TriplesMap of this organisation is called “OrganisationMapping”. This name is a unique reference used to generate the rdf dataset, and to refer to it in other mappings.

A TripleMap has:

1.  `rml:logicalSource` : containing the source (it can be the xml notice that is being  transformied, or a CSV/JSON file containing the controlled values)

2. `rml:referenceFormulation` : defining the parser for the file. In the case of the XML notices XPath is used, while for the CSV/JSON files it is `ql:CSV/ql:JsonPath`
3. `rml:iterator` : the path were the RML mapping starts iterating for this Organisation Mapping.

===== SubjectMap

The subjectMap describes how to generate a unique subject value of a TriplesMap (e.g. Organisation).

----
 rr:subjectMap
       [
           rr:template
               "http://data.europa.eu/a4g/resource/Organisation/{replace(replace(/TED_EXPORT/CODED_DATA_SECTION/NOTICE_DATA/NO_DOC_OJS, ' ', '-' ), '/' , '-')}/{substring-before(substring-after(unparsed-text('https://www.uuidtools.com/api/generate/v3/namespace/ns:url/name/' || count(preceding::*)+1),'[\"'),'\"]')}" ;
           rr:class org:Organization

       ] ;
----


The subject should be unique to each different organisation found in an XML notice. To do that, a concatenation of

1. a cleaned reference of the notice file
`replace(replace(/TED_EXPORT/CODED_DATA_SECTION/NOTICE_DATA/NO_DOC_OJS, ' ', '-' ), '/' , '-')`; and
2. a cleaned result of a `MD5` function which returns a UUID based on the position of the iterator that is unique to each organisation on the XML notice is used. This is done with `substring-before(substring-after(unparsed-text('https://www.uuidtools.com/api/generate/v3/namespace/ns:url/name/' || count(preceding::*)+1),'[\"'),'\"]')`;
3. the type of the mapping is defined by rr:class org:Organization

This solution also helps us to handle having nested tags, by giving each of them a different uuid via the result of the position XPath function.

===== predicateObjectMap

A nested set of predicates objects map to each predicate/object of the organisation instance.

----
rr:predicateObjectMap
   [
   rr:predicate epo:hasName ;
   rr:objectMap
           [
               rml:reference "OFFICIALNAME"
           ]
   ] ;
----

In this part of a TriplesMap we find two components:

1. A predicate `rr:predicate epo:hasName` ;
2. An objectMap, which can be either
.. a rml:reference which is the XPath (starting from the iterator) into the XML notice corresponding to the value of the predicate (OFFICIALNAME), or
.. a rml:template that contains a combination of string and XPath expression

===== Referenceingo other mappings

A referencing object map allows using the subjects of another Triplesmap as the objects generated by a predicate-object map.
There are two use cases for connecting two TriplesMaps using the `rr:parentTriplesMap` pattern

* A referencing object map is represented by a resource that has exactly one `rr:parentTriplesMap` property (without joint condition). Here is an example of connecting the Organisation to its ContactPoint

----
rr:predicateObjectMap
   [
       rr:predicate epo:hasDefaultContactPoint ;
       rr:objectMap
           [
               rr:parentTriplesMap <#ContactPoint>
           ] ;
   ] ;

----

* A referencing object map is represented by a resource that has many `rr:parentTriplesMap` properties (we use a `rr:joinCondition`). Below is an example of connecting an Address to its NUTS code:

----
rr:predicateObjectMap
   [
       rr:predicate locn:adminUnitL1 ;
       rr:objectMap
           [
               rr:parentTriplesMap <#nuts>;
               rr:joinCondition [
                   rr:child "*:NUTS/@CODE";
                   rr:parent "code.value";
               ];
           ] ;
   ] ;

----

A join condition is represented by a resource that has exactly one value for each of the following two properties:

* `rr:child`, whose value is known as the join condition's child reference (the path into the Address TriplesMap)
* `rr:parent`, whose value is known as the join condition's parent source (the path into the ContactPont TriplesMap))

=== Document technical and philosophical issues

While writing the mapping rules, it is necessary to document any issues that are not solvable, or that raise interesting questions.
//, in the https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnvD6XXYPSDzv_VukDHswzYKd_-PDUMe7E-kUGHNcc8/edit?usp=sharing[Observations/Questions about mapping generation] Google doc.
If warranted, a Jira task should be also created to address the given issue.

Problems that were successfully resolved should be integrated into this guide as recommendations. Deleting the issue from the “Problem description” document is NOT recommended, so that the different issues can be kept track of, and that thinking process that went into choosing the ultimate solution(s) is recorded.
