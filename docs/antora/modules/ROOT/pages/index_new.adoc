== What is the TED Open Data Service?

[sidebar]
--
The TED Open Data Service continuously converts notices from the xml standard form format available on the TED Website into RDF format. The RDF data is stored in the Publications Office's (OP) RDF https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore[triple store] named the "Cellar", and is publicly available (open). Making this data open for querying is part of the https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/strategy-data[European Data Strategy] which is working towards connecting EU data across sectors for the benefit of citizens, businesses, researchers, and public administrations, to name a few.

=== Querying TED Open Data
[sidebar]
--
Anyone, with a little know-how, and with help from the resources provided, can learn to create their own queries, and benefit from data on EU public procurement. Queries can be submitted via Cellar's https://publications.europa.eu/webapi/rdf/sparql[SPARQL endpoint], for which there is a link on the https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies[EU Vocabularies page].


This section on querying (reusing) public procurement data introduces the resources and guides available to help those interested improve their querying knowledge and skills.

== Mapping Suites

[sidebar]
--
The Mapping Suites section is for those who wish to use a service that converts XML data into RDF, and deals with the creation of mappings or mapping suites for this purpose. This section is aimed at technical users wishing to create rules for data conversion from XML to RDF. Mappings and mapping suites are part of the the "behind the scenes" process that precedes RDF data being placed in the OP's Cellar triple store for querying. Here the process converts TED Notice data, in XML format, into RDF triples that are stored in Cellar.
