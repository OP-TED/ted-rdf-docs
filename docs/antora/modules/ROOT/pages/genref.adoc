// = The Motivation for the TED Open Data Service



A mapping suite within the TED Open Data Service is a set of mappings that define how an XML document representing an e-Procurement notice is transformed into an equivalent RDF graph representation that conforms to the eProcurement ontology. These mappings appear in different forms, and the relevant components of a mapping suite are organised into a package known as a *mapping suite package*. A mapping suite can be broken down further into mapping suite packages, one per type of standard form mapped.
