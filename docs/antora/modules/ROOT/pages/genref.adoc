A mapping suite, within the TED Semantic Web Service, is a set of mappings that define how an XML document representing an e-Procurement Notice is transformed to an equivalent RDF graph representation that conforms to the eProcurement ontology. These mappings manifest in different forms, and a mapping suite has its relevant components organized in a package, which is refered to as a *mapping suite package*.A mapping suite can be broken down further into mapping suite packages, one per type of standard form mapped.
