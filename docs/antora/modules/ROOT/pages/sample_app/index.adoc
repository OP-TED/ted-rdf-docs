= Sample Applications

A sample application, often referred to as a demo or prototype, is a functional representation of a software program or system that demonstrates its basic features, functionalities, and capabilities. In the context of TED-SWS (TED Semantic Web Services), a sample application would refer to a functional representation of how to access data processed by the system.

== Glossary

* *RDF* stands for Resource Description Framework. RDF is a standardized data model used to represent information on the web. RDF plays a crucial role in xref:ROOT:index.adoc[TED-SWS] because it provides a standardized and structured format for representing the procurement data made available through the service. This allows for efficient querying, processing, and integration of the data into various applications and systems.

* *SPARQL Query* represents query language used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in RDF format.

* *Jupyter Notebook* is an interactive computing environment that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. It's particularly useful for working with data and performing data analysis, making it a valuable tool for xref:ROOT:mapping_suite/index.adoc[accessing and processing] data from TED-SWS.

* *Python* is a widely used programming language that can be employed to retrieve data and xref:ROOT:sample_app/jupyter_notebook_python.adoc[perform operations] on the RDF data provided by TED-SWS.

* *R language* refers to a popular programming language and environment specifically relevant for statistical computing, xref:ROOT:sample_app/jupyter_notebook_r.adoc[data analysis], and graphical representation that is used to retrieve and perform operations on the RDF data provided by TED-SWS.

* *MS Excel* refers to Microsoft Excel, which is a widely used spreadsheet program developed by Microsoft used as a versatile tool for xref:ROOT:sample_app/ms_excel.adoc[handling and analysing] data obtained from TED-SWS.

* *Code Editor* refers to a software tool or environment where users can write, edit, and execute code. It allows to easily create scripts or programs to retrieve data from TED-SWS and perform operations on the RDF data.

* *Jupyter Notebook Kernel* refers to the computational engine that executes the code within a Jupyter Notebook. It determines which programming language is used to run the code in the notebook. For example, if you're working with TED-SWS in a Jupyter Notebook, you might choose to use a Python kernel, which means that you'll be writing and executing Python code.

* *Business Questions* (BQ) refer to specific inquiries or information needs that pertain to business operations, procurement activities, or related aspects. These questions are typically posed by organizations, researchers, or individuals seeking to gain insights, make informed decisions, or conduct analyses based on the data provided by TED-SWS.

== Prerequisites

To use TED-SWS sample apps, you will need the following:

Understanding of RDF and SPARQL:: Familiarity with RDF (Resource Description Framework) and SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is crucial. TED-SWS provides data in RDF format and utilizes SPARQL for querying.

Access to a Programming Language:: You should have proficiency in a programming language capable of making HTTP requests and processing data. Common choices include Python or R.

Knowledge of Semantic Web Technologies:: A basic understanding of Semantic Web concepts and technologies is beneficial. This includes knowledge of RDF triples, ontologies, and linked data principles.

Development Environment:: Set up a development environment for your chosen programming language or at least ensure that you have installed MS Excel.

Understanding of EU Procurement Data:: If your goal is to work with specific types of EU procurement data, such as contract notices or award notices, it's important to have a basic understanding of these concepts and the associated https://docs.ted.europa.eu/EPO/latest/index.html[ontology].
