= Sample Applications

Sample applications, often referred to as demos or prototypes, are functional representations of a software programs or systems that demonstrate their basic features, functionalities, and capabilities. In the context of TED-SWS (TED Semantic Web Services), a sample application would refer to a functional representation of how to access data processed by the system.



== Prerequisites

To use TED-SWS sample applications, the following are needed:

Understanding of RDF and SPARQL:: Familiarity with RDF (Resource Description Framework) and SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is crucial. TED-SWS provides data in RDF format and utilizes SPARQL for querying.

Access to a Programming Language:: Proficiency in a programming language capable of making HTTP requests and processing data is necessary. Common choices include Python or R.

Knowledge of Semantic Web Technologies:: A basic understanding of Semantic Web concepts and technologies is beneficial. This includes knowledge of RDF triples, ontologies, and linked data principles.

Development Environment:: Setting up a development environment for your chosen programming language, or at least having MS Excel installed, is necessary.

Understanding of EU Procurement Data:: If the goal is to work with specific types of EU procurement data, such as contract notices or award notices, it's important to have a basic understanding of these concepts and the associated https://docs.ted.europa.eu/EPO/latest/index.html[ontology].
