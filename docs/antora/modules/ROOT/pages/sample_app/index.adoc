= Sample Applications

A sample application, often referred to as a demo or prototype, is a functional representation of a software program or system that demonstrates its basic features, functionalities, and capabilities. In the context of TED-SWS (TED Semantic Web Services), a sample application would refer to a functional representation of how to access data processed by the system.



== Prerequisites

To use TED-SWS sample apps, you will need the following:

Understanding of RDF and SPARQL:: Familiarity with RDF (Resource Description Framework) and SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is crucial. TED-SWS provides data in RDF format and utilizes SPARQL for querying.

Access to a Programming Language:: You should have proficiency in a programming language capable of making HTTP requests and processing data. Common choices include Python or R.

Knowledge of Semantic Web Technologies:: A basic understanding of Semantic Web concepts and technologies is beneficial. This includes knowledge of RDF triples, ontologies, and linked data principles.

Development Environment:: Set up a development environment for your chosen programming language or at least ensure that you have installed MS Excel.

Understanding of EU Procurement Data:: If your goal is to work with specific types of EU procurement data, such as contract notices or award notices, it's important to have a basic understanding of these concepts and the associated https://docs.ted.europa.eu/EPO/latest/index.html[ontology].
