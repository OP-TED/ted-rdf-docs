=== Reusing Mapping suite packages

The structure of the package evolves during through the different phases of the mapping development process. Three phases of the mapping development are described in this section.

==== Initial Phase
*Audience*: Semantic Engineers
In the first, initial, phase, when the Semantic Engineers start working on a new mapping suite, they should set up a package folder structure similar to the one described below.

One package per form number is considered the optimal solution when naming and organising  the various mapping suites.

The structure of an example mapping package folder structure is presented below:

/package_Fxx

/transformation

conceptual_mappings.xlsx

/mappings

*.rml.ttl

/resources

    *.json, *.xml, *.csv

/test_data

    *.xml

/package_Fxx root folder of the mapping suite

/transformation/conceptual_mappings.xlsx manually created

/transformation/resources additional resources possibly needed by the transformation rules;
The content of this folder should be automatically generated by the a mapping package processor, based on the "Resources" sheet of the conceptual_mappings.xlsx
